INTRODUCTION:
My Surgery Mate provides a complete platform for patients of surgery. We aim to inform, educate, and monitor patients in all aspects surrounding surgical procedures. Our unified portal provides an elegant and accessible space with intentions of pioneering a new approach for patients, caretakers, and doctors. 
Our goal is to serve in all timelines of a surgical operation, by:
- providing pre-surgery information and responsibilities,
- explaining the surgical operation and relevant anatomy at a high level
- providing post-surgery knowledge,
- and, monitoring patient symptoms for triage by medical personnel.

CLOSING NOTES:
- The original inspiration for this idea was from a project that Nicholas worked on last year (see https://mysurgerymate.com/). This idea and website was based on a medical innovation design class and the work performed in that course will not overlap on work to be done during this course. The original website was simply a vehicle for an innovative medical idea (a proof a concept), it did not pertain to website design, ineternet technologies, revenue models, or ecommerce. The original website was designed with Squarespace and contains no handwritten html or css.
